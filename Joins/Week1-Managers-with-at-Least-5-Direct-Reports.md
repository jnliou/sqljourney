## Overview

The `Employee` table is designed to maintain a simple yet comprehensive list of employees within a company. It tracks not only individual employees but also their departmental alignments and managerial relationships.

Employee =
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

## Schema

The table is comprised of four columns:

- `id`: An integer value uniquely identifying each employee within the company. It serves as the primary key for the table.
- `name`: A variable character field that stores the full name of the employee.
- `department`: A variable character field representing the department to which the employee is assigned.
- `managerId`: An integer value that references the `id` of the manager to whom the employee reports directly.

## Constraints

- The `id` field is unique across the table, ensuring that each employee has a distinct identifier.
- The `managerId` can be null, indicating that the respective employee does not have a manager.
- An employee cannot be their own manager; thus, `managerId` cannot be the same as the `id` for any row.
- The `managerId` field, when not null, will correspond to the `id` of another employee who is designated as a manager.

## Relationships

- The `managerId` field establishes a hierarchical relationship between employees, indicating who reports to whom.
- If `managerId` is null, the employee is considered to not have a manager, which might signify a top-level position, such as a CEO or a sole proprietor.

## Usage

The primary function of this table is to facilitate queries about employee-management structures, such as:

- Determining the direct reports of a particular manager.
- Understanding the departmental structure by listing employees under each department.
- Identifying managers with a specific minimum number of direct reports.

## Example Query

An example use case for this table is to find managers with at least five direct reports. A query can be crafted to return a list of such managers, displaying their names and the count of direct reports.

The output will be a simple table with the `name` of the manager(s) who meet the criteria. Here's an example of what the output might look like based on the provided data:

```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
```

In the above example, 'John' is listed as a manager with at least five direct reports.

## Solution

## Step 1 - JOIN or INNER JOIN 
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM Employee a 
JOIN Employee b ON a.id = b.managerId 
```

* The purpose of joining a.id onto b.managerID was so we can identify who's manager each employee reports to. 

| id  | name | department | managerId | id  | name  | department | managerId |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------- | --- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 101 | John | A          | null      | 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

```sql

SELECT a.name 
FROM Employee a 
JOIN Employee b ON a.id = b.managerId 
GROUP BY b.managerId 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
```

* We want to ensure we SELECT *a.name*, as the output will be just the name of the manager that people report to. 
* 

## NOTES

INNER JOIN: This is a type of join that returns rows from both tables that satisfy the given condition. If there is no match, the result set will not include rows from either table. Itâ€™s the most common type of join.

JOIN: By default, without any other keyword, JOIN is equivalent to INNER JOIN. In other words, if you write SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name; it defaults to an INNER JOIN.
