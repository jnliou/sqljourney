# SQL Journey :trophy:

Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey to mastering SQL through consistent practice and perseverance. This is a chronicle of my daily progress through various SQL challenges, primarily focusing on LeetCode problems and other platforms that offer SQL practice tests.

## My Goal :dart:

My mission is to complete at least one LeetCode SQL question every day. I believe that regular practice is key to proficiency, and I'm committed to making this a habit. By tackling a variety of problems, I aim to deepen my understanding of SQL and enhance my problem-solving skills.

## Progress Tracker :bar_chart:

Below is my weekly progress chart where I track the number of problems I've solved. I update this tracker at the end of each week to reflect my accomplishments and to stay accountable.

| Week               | Problems Solved | Cumulative Total |
